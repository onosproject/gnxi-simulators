Simple simulators, used for integration testing of ONOS interactions with devices and various orchestration entities, e.g:

- Configuring devices via gNMI and OpenConfig
- Controlling operation of devices via gNOI
- Shaping pipelines and controlling traffic flow via P4 programms and P4Runtime

The simulator facilities are available as Go package libraries, executable commands and as published Docker containers.
